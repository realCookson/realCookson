    <h1>Recipe for the most delicious cinnamon rolls</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my recipe. My name is Piotr Sasin and I would like to introduce you to my recipe for cinnamon rolls, that made my girlfriend impossible to forget about them, after she ate those. At least once in a month she reminds me and asks me when I would cook them again. Lets get started.</p>
    <h2><i>You will find a girlfriend or boyfriend immediately after you make those!</i></h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <h3>Dough:</h3>
      <li>250 ml of milk</li>
      <li>2 sachets of dried instant yeast (14 g)</li>
      <li>500 g wheat flour</li>
      <li>50 g sugar</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>70 g butter</li>
      <li>For spreading: 1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h3>Filling:</h3>
      <li>70 g butter</li>
      <li>3 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 tbsp vanilla sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cane sugar</li>
      <li>Zest grated from 1/2 lemon (if desired)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h3>Glaze:</h3>
      <li>3 tbsp lemon juice</li>
      <li>Approx. 3/4 cup caster sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Take the ingredients out of the fridge beforehand and warm at room temperature. The butter should be soft.</li>
      <li>Pour the instant dry yeast into warm (but not hot) milk, add a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of flour, mix and leave to swell for about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Pour the flour into the bowl of a mixer or large bowl. Add the sugar and salt. Add the leavened dough and start slowly mixing the dough. Add the eggs and then, while kneading the dough, add the soft butter piece by piece.</li>
      <li>Knead (by hand or with a planetary mixer) for about 15 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Cover with a cloth and leave to rise in a warm place for at least 1 hour.</li>
      <li>After this time, turn the dough out onto a board or countertop and knead for a while getting rid of any air bubbles. Divide the dough into 2 parts and gently roll out each part into a 30 x 30 cm pancake.</li>
      <li>Brush the dough squares one by one with soft butter and sprinkle with a mixture of cinnamon, vanilla sugar, cane sugar and grated zest (if using).</li>
      <li>Wrap the dough into rolls and cut each roll crosswise into 10 slices about 2cm thick. Place all 20 pieces on a large rectangular baking tray lined with baking paper. Set aside for approx. 15 - 20 minutes to rise.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C. Brush the top of the buns lightly with whisked (and not cold) egg and bake until golden brown for about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Once cooled, pour over the icing: heat the lemon juice, add icing sugar and mix.</li>
    </ol>
