                    OG breezed past a Håkon "⁠hallzerk⁠" Fjærli-less Complexity 13-3 on 
                    Ancient in their first match at the Austin Major — a victory decorated 
                    by an imperious display from Nico "⁠nicoodoz⁠" Tamjidi.

                <p>
                    HEROIC, B8, FlyQuest, and Wildcard are just one best-of-three away 
                    from advancing to Stage 2 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major after securing 
                    victories in the 1-0 pool.

                <h2>Fluxo, Imperial, Chinggis Warriors, and Metizport condemned to 0-2 elimination pool</h2>
                <p>
                    Nemiga, Complexity, Legacy, and TYLOO have secured their first victories 
                    at the BLAST.tv Austin Major and avoided an early trip to the 0-2 elimination pool.
                    Those wins came at the expense of Fluxo, Chinggis Warriors, Imperial, 
                    and Metizport, who have their backs against the wall heading into day two and 
                    will have to fight to keep their Major campaigns afloat.
