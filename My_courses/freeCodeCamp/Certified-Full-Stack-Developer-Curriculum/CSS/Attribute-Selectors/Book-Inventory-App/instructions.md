User Stories:

You should have an h1 element with the text Book Inventory.
You should have a table element with columns named Title, Author, Category, Status, and Rate.
Your table should have at least four rows, the first for the column headings and the rest filled with book information.
Each table row inside the table body should have either the class read, to-read, or in-progress.
td elements of the Status column should contain a span element with the class of status surrounding the text Read, To Read, or In Progress, depending on the class of that row.
td elements of the Rate column should contain a span element with the class of rate wrapping three empty span elements.
.rate elements placed inside .read rows should have an additional class with the value of either one, two, or three, depending on the personal rate. This value should come after rate.
You should create three attribute selectors to target the elements with the class of read, to-read, and in-progress, and set their background-image property to use a linear-gradient of your choice.
You should set the display property of each span element to inline-block.
You should use an attribute selector to target the span elements with the class of status that are descendants of tr elements with the class of to-read and set their border and background-image properties.
