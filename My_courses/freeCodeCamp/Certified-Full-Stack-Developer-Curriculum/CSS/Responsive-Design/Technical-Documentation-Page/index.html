                    <h2>What is color theory in design?</h2>

                    <p>Color theory is the study of how colors interact with each other and 
                        how they affect our perception. It covers color relationships, color 
                        harmony, and the psychological impact of color. Let's start diving 
                        into this world. Colors can be classified as either primary, secondary, 
                        or tertiary.</p>
                    <p>Primary colors, yellow, blue, and red, are the fundamental hues from 
                        which all other colors are derived.</p>
                    <p>Secondary colors result from mixing equal amounts of two primary colors. 
                        Green, orange, and purple are examples of secondary colors. For example, 
                        green is the result of combining yellow and blue.</p>
                    <p>Tertiary colors result from combining a primary color with a neighboring 
                        secondary color. Yellow-Green, Blue-Green, and Blue-Violet, are examples 
                        of tertiary colors.</p>
                    <p>This is a fundamental classification in the world of color theory, but 
                        there are other ways to classify colors. They can be classified as warm 
                        or cool, based on their temperature.</p>
                    <p>Warm colors, like reds, oranges, and yellows, evoke feelings of comfort, 
                        warmth, and coziness. Cool colors, like blues, green, and purples, evoke 
                        feelings of calmness, serenity, and professionalism.</p>
                    <p>Colors can also be represented through color models. They are essential 
                        for describing and reproducing colors in a standard way. Frequently used 
                        color models include the RGB model, the HSV model, and the HSL model. 
                        They represent colors based on different properties. You will learn more 
                        about them in future lectures.</p>
                    <p>Great. Now that you know more about this, let's talk about a fundamental 
                        tool that designers use to represent colors and their relationships. 
                        The color wheel is a circular diagram that shows how colors relate to 
                        each other. It's an essential tool for designers because it helps them 
                        to select color combinations. This is very helpful for creating color 
                        palettes and color schemes.</p>
                    <p>A color scheme is the set of colors chosen for a specific design or 
                        project. They are usually based on the principles of color theory. 
                        By understanding the relationships between colors on the wheel, you can 
                        develop different types of color schemes. Let's see some of them.</p>
                    <p>Analogous color schemes create cohesive and soothing experiences. 
                        They have analogous colors, which are adjacent to each other in 
                        the color wheel.</p>
                    <p>Complementary color schemes create high contrast and visual impact. 
                        Their colors are located on the opposite ends of the color wheel, 
                        relative to each other.</p>
                    <p>Color contrast is essential for web accessibility. It ensures that text 
                        and other important elements are clearly distinguishable from 
                        their background. This is especially important for people with 
                        visual disabilities.</p>
                    <p>In an RGB color wheel, complementary colors are located at the opposite 
                        ends of the wheel. For example, magenta is complementary to green and 
                        blue is complementary to yellow and so on.</p>
                    <p>A triadic color scheme has vibrant colors. They are made from colors that 
                        are approximately equidistant from each other. If they are connected, 
                        they form an equilateral triangle on the color wheel.</p>
                    <p>And finally, we have the monochromatic color scheme. In this color scheme, 
                        all the colors are derived from the same base color by adjusting its 
                        lightness, darkness, and saturation. This evokes a feeling of unity 
                        and harmony while still creating contrast.</p>
                    <p>And finally, here are some tips for using color effectively 
                        in web development:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a color scheme that defines your website's branding.</li>
                        <li>Use colors to evoke the emotions and perceptions that align with your goals.</li>
                        <li>Choose colors with enough contrast to make your website accessible for everyone.</li>
                        <li>Use color to highlight important elements of your website, like buttons.</li>
                        <li>Use color consistently and use it to create a visual hierarchy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Color theory is a core aspect of design. By understanding color psychology, 
                        harmonies, and accessibility, you can create effective designs, evoke 
                        emotions, and enhance user experience.</p>

                    <header>Named Colors in CSS</header>
                        
                    <h2>What are named colors in CSS, and when to use them?</h2>
                        
                    <p>In CSS, colors play a crucial role in designing web pages, enhancing 
                        readability, setting the mood, and improving user experience. 
                        One of the simplest ways to define colors in CSS is by using named colors. 
                        Named colors are predefined color names recognized by browsers. Here is 
                        an example of using a named color for a paragraph element:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                p {
                                    color: red;
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>In this example, we're using the named 
                        color <span>red</span> to style the text in a paragraph.</p>
                    <p>Named colors in CSS are a collection of 140 standard color names like 
                        <span>red</span>, <span>blue</span>, <span>yellow</span>, <span>aqua</span>, 
                        <span>fuchsia</span>, <span>black</span>, and so on. 
                        These names are simple to use and make your code more readable, and 
                        they are self-descriptive.</p>
                    <p>Named colors are useful for quick prototyping, simple designs, 
                        and improving code readability. Here is an another example of using 
                        named colors for an <span>h1</span> selector:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                h1 {
                                    color: navy;
                                    background-color: lightgray;
                                    font-size: 24px;
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>In this example, the heading text will be styled in navy, with a light gray 
                        background. The readability of the code improves since named colors 
                        provide an immediate visual understanding of the intended style.</p>
                    <p>Named colors in CSS are convenient but limited, with only 140 available 
                        options. They may not offer the precise shade needed 
                        for more detailed designs.</p>
                    <p>Named colors in CSS are a great way to apply colors quickly and 
                        descriptively. While they are useful for basic designs, prototyping, 
                        and improving code readability, their limited range makes them 
                        less suitable for complex designs requiring precise color control.</p>
                    <p>By understanding the strengths and limitations of named colors, you 
                        can determine when it’s best to use them over more detailed color 
                        models like RGB or HSL, which you will learn about in future videos.</p>

                    <header>RGB Color Model</header>
                        
                    <h2>What is the RGB color model, and how does the RGB function work in CSS?</h2>
                        
                    <p>When working with colors in CSS, understanding the RGB color model is 
                        essential. RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue — the primary 
                        colors of light. These three colors are combined in different intensities 
                        to create a wide range of colors.</p>
                    <p>The RGB color model is an additive color model, which means colors are created 
                        by combining light at varying intensities.</p>
                    <p>The intensity of each color can range from <span>0</span> (which means no light) 
                        to <span>255</span> (which means full light). By mixing different levels of red, 
                        green, and blue, you can produce any color you see on your screen. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Black is represented by <span>rgb(0, 0, 0)</span>, which means no light for any of the three colors.</li>
                        <li>White is represented by <span>rgb(255, 255, 255)</span>, which means full light intensity for all three colors.</li>
                        <li>Red is represented by <span>rgb(255, 0, 0)</span>, with full intensity for red and none for green or blue.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In CSS, the <span>rgb()</span> function allows you to define colors using the RGB color model. 
                        The function takes three values, each representing the intensity of red, green, 
                        and blue light, respectively. Here is the basic syntax:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                element {
                                    color: rgb(red, green, blue);
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>The values for red, green, and blue can range from <span>0</span> to <span>255</span>, where <span>0</span> represents 
                        the absence of that color, and <span>255</span> represents full saturation. Here is an example of how you might use 
                        the <span>rgb()</span> function in CSS:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                p {
                                    color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>This code would change the text color of the paragraph to red because the red value is set 
                        to <span>255</span>, while green and blue are set to <span>0</span>.</p>
                    <p>CSS also provides the <span>rgba()</span> function, which adds a fourth value —alpha— that controls 
                        the transparency of the color. The alpha value ranges from <span>0</span> (completely transparent) 
                        to <span>1</span> (completely opaque). Here is an example of using <span>rgba()</span>:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                div {
                                    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5);
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>This code would apply a semi-transparent blue background to a <span>div</span> element because 
                        the red and green values are set to <span>0</span>, the blue value is set to <span>255</span>, 
                        and the alpha value is set to <span>0.5</span> (50% transparency).</p>
                    <p>The RGB color model is especially useful for digital media because it directly corresponds to 
                        how screens display colors. Monitors and displays use tiny red, green, and blue pixels to 
                        create the colors you see. By controlling the intensity of these pixels through RGB values, 
                        you can achieve a wide range of colors for your web design.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, the RGB model is ideal when working with dynamic designs. For instance, if you 
                        want to create animations or color effects that require real-time changes, the flexibility 
                        of the RGB function allows you to modify colors programmatically.</p>
                    <p>By understanding the RGB color model and how to use the <span>rgb()</span> and <span>rgba()</span> 
                        functions in CSS, you'll have greater control over how colors are displayed on your web pages. 
                        You can create vibrant designs, transparency, and even programmatically adjust colors 
                        for dynamic effects.</p>

                    <h2>What is the HSL color model, and how does the <span>hsl()</span> function work in CSS?</h2>
                        
                    <p>When styling websites, one of the most versatile and intuitive ways to work with color is by using 
                        the HSL color model. HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness — three key components 
                        that define a color.</p>
                    <p>The HSL color model represents colors in a way that is more in line with how humans perceive color. 
                        In this lecture, we will explore what the HSL color model is and how the <span>hsl()</span> 
                        function is used in CSS.</p>
                    <p>The hue is the color type, represented as an angle on the color wheel, which ranges from <span>0</span> 
                        to <span>360</span> degrees. For example, <span>0</span> degrees represents red, <span>120</span> 
                        degrees is green, and <span>240</span> degrees is blue. By adjusting the hue, you shift through 
                        different colors on the spectrum</p>
                    <p>Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of the color. It is measured as a percentage 
                        from <span>0%</span> (a completely desaturated, grayscale color) to <span>100%</span> 
                        (the most vibrant form of that color). A color with <span>100%</span> saturation is fully vivid, 
                        while a color with <span>0%</span> saturation appears as a shade of gray.</p>
                    <p>Lightness determines how light or dark the color is, again measured as a percentage. A lightness 
                        value of <span>0%</span> will produce black, <span>50%</span> will give you the normal tone of the hue, 
                        and <span>100%</span> will result in white.</p>
                    <p>In CSS, the <span>hsl()</span> function is used to define colors using the HSL color model. 
                        Here is the basic syntax:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                element {
                                    color: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness);
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>Let's break this down with an example:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">    
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                p {
                                    color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%);
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>In this case, the hue is <span>120</span> degrees, which corresponds to green. The saturation 
                        is <span>100%</span>, so the green will be fully vivid. The lightness is <span>50%</span>, 
                        so it's at its normal tone — neither too dark nor too light. As a result, the text color of the paragraph 
                        will be a bright green.</p>
                    <p>One of the main advantages of the HSL color model is its intuitive nature. It makes it easy to adjust 
                        a color’s vibrancy or lightness by tweaking the saturation and lightness values without having to 
                        alter the core color (hue).</p>
                    <p>For instance, if you want to create different shades or tints of the same color, you can simply 
                        adjust the lightness value.</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                div.light {
                                    background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 80%);
                                }

                                div.dark {
                                    background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 20%);
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>Here, both <span>div</span> elements are using the same hue (<span>240</span> degrees, which is blue), 
                        but one has a lightness of <span>80%</span> (a lighter shade of blue), and the other has 
                        a lightness of <span>20%</span> (a darker shade of blue).</p>
                    <p>Just like the RGB model has an <span>rgba()</span> function to include transparency, the HSL model has 
                        an <span>hsla()</span> function. The fourth parameter in this function represents the alpha value, 
                        which controls the opacity of the color. Here is the basic syntax:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                element {
                                    background-color: hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha);
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>Let's take a look at an example:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                div {
                                    background-color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>This code would give the <span>div</span> a semi-transparent red background, where the hue is set 
                        to <span>0</span> degrees (red), saturation is <span>100%</span>, lightness is <span>50%</span>, 
                        and alpha is <span>0.5</span> (50% opacity).</p>
                    <p>The HSL color model is particularly useful when you need to create color schemes and adjust 
                        shades or tints easily.</p>
                    <p>Because HSL separates the hue from saturation and lightness, you can keep a consistent color theme 
                        while tweaking lightness for shadows or highlights. This level of flexibility makes HSL a favorite 
                        for designers and developers alike.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, HSL makes color values more readable and understandable when compared to other methods 
                        like hex codes or RGB. You can more clearly see the intent behind the color and adjust accordingly, 
                        especially when experimenting with different designs.</p>
                    <p>With the HSL color model, you gain more flexibility in controlling color tones, saturation, 
                        and lightness, making it a powerful tool for creating rich and dynamic designs in CSS.</p>
