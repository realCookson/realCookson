A popular set of breakpoints corresponds to common device categories:

Small devices (smartphones): up to 640px.
Medium devices (tablets): 641px to 1024px.
Large devices (desktops): 1025px and larger.

Some designers prefer a more granular approach, using breakpoints like:

Extra small devices: up to 576px.
Small devices: 577px to 768px.
Medium devices: 769px to 992px.
Large devices: 993px to 1200px.
Extra large devices: 1201px and larger.

It's important to note that these are not strict rules, but rather common practices.
The trend in modern responsive design is moving towards a more fluid approach, where designs adapt smoothly across a wide range of screen sizes, rather than making dramatic changes at set breakpoints.

Here are some other common examples for breakpoints:

Extra small device: under 576px.
Small device: more than or equal to 576px.
Medium device: more than or equal to 768px.
Large device: more than or equal to 992px.
Extra large device: more than or equal to 1200px.
Extra extra large device: more than or equal to 1400px.
